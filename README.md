## Description

Iâ€™ve developed a robust Twitter clone built with **Next.js**, designed to deliver a seamless and dynamic user experience. The app enables users to post, delete, and bookmark tweets effortlessly, with real-time notifications powered by **Pusher** for instant updates. Users can engage with tweets through likes and comments, while profiles for all users are accessible for easy interaction. Image uploads are managed via **Cloudinary**, ensuring smooth media handling. A dedicated settings page allows users to edit their details, and a single post view offers detailed tweet exploration. Additionally, users can follow top profiles, with advanced search and tweet preview functionality implemented using server actions for enhanced performance.
